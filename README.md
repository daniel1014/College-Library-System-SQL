# College-Library-System-SQL-
Database System Coursework

This project aims to outline the conceptual design of a database for a college library and implement the database application. The database application will be discussed and implemented by detailing the following:

1)	An entity-relationship diagram (ER diagram) and a relational schema of the database
2)	SQL commands to create the tables of the database
3)	Sample test data for the database
4)	Views for the database
5)	SQL queries and explanations
6)	Triggers for the database
7)	Data security issues of the database

The DBMS chosen is Oracle Live SQL, and the scripts presented in a separate file of the report will be aligned with the DBMS.
